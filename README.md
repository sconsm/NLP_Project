# Analyzing Children's Stories (NLP)
## *Why is It So Important to Read to Our Kids?*
Metis NLP Project:
Using NLP to Analyze Children's Stories

### Introduction and Objectives:
At least **250 million** of the world’s 650 million primary school age children can’t read, write, or do basic mathematics! (According to United Nations 2014 findings). Not only is this number astounding, it's simply not ok. Reading is so important to young children's growth and development, however, not every child has the access to such resources. Thus, knowing how important reading is to children, my main question is: *why* is reading to our kids so important? I found it very interesting to look at language from the most basic reading level --at childhood. This is most likely everyone's first introduction to text language, so what can we learn from this. By exploring NLP techniques, I aim to understand what exactly is in the classic texts that children learn. What are the common themes in children's books? What can this tell us about how we shape our youth? Expanding beyond this projeect-- how can this knowledge of children's text help us provide all children with the necessary tools they need to grow. The overall objective of this project is to gain insights into the common themes within children's books.

### Features and Target Variables:


------

### Data Used:

Data gathered from the Gutenberg Project, a free online ebook website.

There are 3 bookshelves related to children's books: **children's picture books, children's instructional books, and children's myths, fairy tales, etc.** I chose to create a dataset based on the top (most popular) books from each of the bookshelves. There are a total of 120 books in the dataset.

### Tools Used:
- pandas
- nltk
- numpy
- scipy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- glob

### Possible Impacts and Practical Applications:
From our topic modeling of our data, we can see how these stories, and the texts specifically, carry a lot of weight in children's growth and development, and therefore can be carried on throughout young adult life. This enables their abilities to think critically, and develop emotions like empathy. This simply emphasizes the need to really understand NLP in childrens stories!

### Future Work:
NLP has become very popular among early childhood development techniques, especially among parents. There are a lot of books and scholarly research articles on this subject matter that are very worth looking into. Overall, we have learned how important it is for childhood development for children to read and be read to, but unfortunately it is not something that many millions of young children have the privilege of receiving. This has many global limitations, and there is much more we can do to provide this basic human right to children everywhere. NLP could be used to help understand and solve global problems. If we understand how crucial text at beginner reader level is, we can use NLP to shape our children in the ways that we know they need in order to grow and develop to the best of their abilities.

Future work revolves around gethering more text data, expanding the types of books and working on a recommendation system that will help parents choose books for their children based on themes and topics they like. This encourages and promotes effective reading and engagement. The goal is to allow more children to be able to read and grow.
